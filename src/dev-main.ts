/**
 * Dev-only entry. Boots the same component tree as the production
 * bundle but renders it into `#app` instead of the host's plugin slot,
 * with a mock host context that lets the UI load data without a
 * backend.
 *
 * The mock API + fixtures + helpers live in `./dev-mock` so they can
 * be unit-tested without triggering this bootstrap. The production
 * bundle (./main.ts) is unaffected.
 *
 * For end-to-end testing against a real backend, run the host dev
 * flow:
 *   1. PHP at :8080 (`composer dev` in spora-local)
 *   2. Plugin dev at :5175 (`npm run dev` here)
 *   3. Host SPA at :5173 (`npm run dev` in spora-frontend)
 * The host's `vite.config.ts → SPORA_PLUGIN_DEV_PORTS` then forwards
 * `/api` to PHP and `/plugins/memories/*` to this dev server.
